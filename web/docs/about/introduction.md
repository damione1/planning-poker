# ðŸŒ± Introduction
<u>DeploySolo is a SaaS starter kit built with carefully chosen software to maximize simplicity and productivity.</u>

It's built with PocketBase on the backend, and htmx on the front end.

[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) is an "Open Source backend in 1 file". Meaning that app essentials like database, auth, files, and administration are taken care of in a simple to deploy executable you fully control.

[htmx](https://htmx.org/) lets you build "modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext". It lets you build apps with a much easier development experience compared to frameworks like React. 

Extending PocketBase as a Go framework to build [hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/) apps is a perfect fit, but it can be difficult to get up and running with a complete web application.

DeploySolo gives you a complete app with extra code samples so you can start today.
