# ðŸš€ Quickstart
After purchase, you will gain access to the DeploySolo repository. To get started, first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) or download the repository. 

Forking is recommended because you will quickly get a repository set up that you can add your features to, and pull in updates from the central repository later.

After it has been downloaded, open it in your terminal. And run the following:

```sh
matt@matt-mbp:~/Development/Projects/deploysolo
$ go run . serve
Listening on :8090
```

You can now navigate to `localhost:8090` in your browser:

Congrats!
