# ðŸ“‚ PocketBase
DeploySolo extends PocketBase as a Go framework.

PocketBase provides backend functionality for core app essentials, such as database, auth, file storage, and an admin dashboard.

Although many code samples and batteries are included to use PocketBase out of the box to serve a complete app, referencing the [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/) documentation will assist in the complete framework feature set.

DeploySolo provides customer support for development questions around PocketBase, and maintenence support for ongoing updates to PocketBase itself.
