# üñ•Ô∏è EC2

This is a walk through for setting up an EC2 server with the correct security permissions.

---

After creating an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account, go to the EC2 dashboard and click "Launch Instance".

Select a distribution of Linux as the OS. Here Debian is chosen.

Specify an instance type and create a key pair for SSH log in. Resource requirements vary by cost and amount of users. Make sure to keep the downloaded `your_key.pem` file.

But a nano instance or greater is recommended for SQLite mode.

And a medium instance or greater is recommended for Docker Compose mode.

For security settings, ensure SSH and HTTPS traffic is enabled.

Return to the global EC2 dashboard and select your newly created instance. Make a note of the public IPv4 address.

Now enter your terminal and locate your key. Likely in `~/Downloads/your_key.pem`. Type:
```
chmod 600 ~/Downloads/your_key.pem
ssh -i "~/Downloads/your_key.pem" admin@{public IPv4}
```

Once you are in the server, finally type
```
curl ifconfig.me
```

Make a note of the returned IP address. This is what we will point our DNS records to in the next step.

## Dependencies

DeploySolo requires golang. Here are the commands to install them, in addition to git.

```sh
# Update package lists and upgrade installed packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Git and Go
sudo apt install git golang -y
```

Reboot the server for permissions to take effect.

## Clone Forked Repo
Now that you've set up a server, you need to get the project source code onto the server.

```sh
git clone github.com/your/repo
```

Congrats! You now have DeploySolo on an EC2 instance.
